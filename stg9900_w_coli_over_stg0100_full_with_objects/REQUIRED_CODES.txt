*Allows for using as many chunks as you want without being constrained to the stage's original properties. Names do not need to match original files with this code on. This makes importing and creating new levels in Shadow much easier.
*
*v2 properly routes non-geo/coli unlike v1, so no more crashing on events
*
*Geo models must still follow:
*[NAME]_[MATTYPE]_[CHUNKNUM]
*
*Collision models must still follow:
*[NAME]_COLI_[CHUNKNUM]
*
*The 2nd and 3rd params can be swapped
